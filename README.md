# About 💻
In order to increase my knowledge and acquire new knowledge, I built this app that consists of selling cinema tickets.
I built a backend application, an api to authenticate the user and their purchased tickets. 
The app has many routes and a lot of communication between them, push notification with firebase, redux to manage component life...


I am very happy with the development of this app, the next step will be to learn how to launch an app in the store 🛍️.

The app was built with:
- Typescript
- React Native
- Expo CLI
- React Native Elements
- Styled-Components
- Redux
- Firebase
- Animated

# Observations about ⚠️
1 - There's no payment system for the purchase of tickets, the buy button instantly buys the ticket.

2 - There's no way to choose the chair in the movie.
